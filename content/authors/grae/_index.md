I'm working to scale one-to-one learning.

In 1984 Benjamin Bloom described the "[Two Sigma Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem)", noting that students tutored with one-to-one techniques performed **two standard deviations better** than students in a traditional class.

He also dismissed large-scale one-to-one learning as "**too costly**" and **not "realistic**".

I believe Bloom was right about the effectiveness of one-to-one learning, but wrong about scalability. I'm building tools to prove that **scalable, accessible one-to-one learning is possible today**.
